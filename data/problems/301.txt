Goran will rent a car for the weekend. He can choose 1 of 2 plans. The first plan has an initial fee of 65 dollars and costs an additional 0.40 dollars per mile driven. The second plan has no initial fee but costs 0.60 dollars per mile driven. How many miles would Goran need to drive for the 2 plans to cost the same?
